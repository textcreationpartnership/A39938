            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EXPERIMENTED PROPOSALS <hi>How the King may have Money to Pay and Maintain his Fleets with eaſe to his People,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe end of our Money is to adjuſt Contracts and Accompts between out ſelves, for it is not Coyned to be Melted or Tranſported.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe and all Tokens of Accompt are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued according to their portableneſs, which prefers Gold before Silver, Jewels before Gold, Bills and Bonds before all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Bills, Bonds, Book Accompts, and even verball promiſes, we transfer from one to the other, which our Law approves of and corroborates.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Satisfying ſecurity therefore cleerly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes and contents us as well as Money, for who would not rather have a Straw, or a piece
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100706:3"/>
of Paper, then an hundred pounds, if he were ſure it would at all times yield him as much as he took it for. Our practice evinceth this, for we purchaſe Bills of Exchange at two or more <hi>per cent.</hi> The Money-Maſter parts with his Coyn for a ſheet of Paper or Parchment. Nay it gets our Money into our Enemies, eſteemed, but in truth, failable Money Banks, though they give but Three <hi>per cent.</hi> uſe, and we Six, nay <hi>Ireland</hi> ten and more <hi>per cent.</hi> For it is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſecurity, not great Uſe, that attracts Money.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Land ſecurity is evidently, of all, the ſureſt, and moſt ſatisfying, where the Title is cleer, and no danger of Counterfeits or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Conqueſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. No Money can be ſurer than Taxes by Act of Parliament, though ten, or more years day of Payment were allowed the people, which this way may be done, and yet the King by making currant Bills thereon, may have it all preſently without any deductions. And by the peoples yearly and eaſy payments theſe Bills may be certainly paid and taken in.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100706:3"/>
7. By ſuch like diſtinct Bills, <hi>London</hi> may be rebuilt, and all Proprietors ſatisfyed for enlarging the Streets, the Fines and Rents of all ſo built, being engaged to ſatisfy and take in all theſe Bills.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The like may be done for Banks of Loan upon Pawns, truly called Mounts of Piety, where the Stock thus coming <hi>gratis,</hi> the Poor (who now pay above 40, 50, nay 60 <hi>per cent.</hi> Uſe, to their ruine, and caſting them and theirs on their Pariſhes charge) may have money at Six <hi>per cent.</hi> The Clothiers on their Cloth the like, till the Merchant or Draper can take it off, and the Clothier, mean time, have Money to go on with his Trade, and keep his Workmen ſtill imployed. The Landed man at Four <hi>per cent.</hi> Uſe, whereby he may improve his Land, or lend his Money to ſuch as can well pay him Six <hi>per cent.</hi> and gain enough. Half this Uſe will ſoon pay and take in theſe Bills, the other half will defray all charges and augment this Mount to a vaſt advantage of all.</p>
            <p n="9">9. By the like way, the Herring Trade may be eſtabliſhed, to the breeding up and maintaining plenty of Marriners enough for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100706:4"/>
the King, Merchant, and Fiſhery; and imploy our Poor from their Childhood, and the profit hereof will ſoon pay and take in theſe Bills alſo: for <hi>John Keymor</hi>'s Books cleerly ſheweth how the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Forreigners, by our Fiſh, make more Money in one year, than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> doth in four years of his <hi>Indies;</hi> and how theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> hereby will certainly eat us out of all Trade, and be cleer Maſters of the Sea, to the terror of all Kings and States.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Credit thus raiſed, is honeſt, becauſe all Bills are ſure to be payd. It prejudiceth no man, becauſe he hath as much uſe of this Bill Money, as if he had the Silver; and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all theſe particulars, to the good of us all. Nor is the way hazardous or untroden, but ſuch as hath been long, and is ſtill uſed by our Neighbours, to the advancing their little Country (not ſo big, nor fruitful as one <hi>Engliſh</hi> County) from Poor Diſtreſſed States, to be <hi>Hogans Mogans,</hi> and all by a real cheat; for no conſiderate man can believe that they have ſo much Money in their Banks, as they give out Bills for. What then do they get? but loſe the Uſe they pay,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100706:4"/>
and their charge in guarding and keeping Accompts.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Theſe leſſen not, but encreaſeth both Bullion and Coyn, where they are uſed; for what Monarch can ſpare ſuch Sums as little <hi>Genoa</hi> lends to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that great Maſter and Merchant of Gold and Silver? and what people generally fuller of Money, and freer from Beggars than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by theſe propoſed courſes.</p>
            <p>If all, or any, of theſe be thought worthy debateing, the Propoſer is confident he can anſwer all objections, and ſhew the way how there ſhall not be any danger of cheat or abuſe in any part thereof.</p>

            <head>Sir EDVVARD FORDE'S ADDITIONAL DEFENCE OF Bill-Credit.</head>
            <p>THat Credit ſatisfies as well as Coin, and drives the greateſt Trade in the World, is certain and viſible to the moſt Judicious; But our Natural jealouſy, blown by malicious whiſpers, would not have Credit and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy compatable. To convince therefore the deceived, and ſilence thoſe who fear and malign our King and Kingdomes proſperity, I here ſhew (part of what I hinted in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my firſt paper) how the there propoſed <hi>Bill-Money</hi> may be juſtly and infallibly paid in by Silver Coyn, which ſome ſo dote on.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100706:6"/>
1. That the Tax of every County be aſſigned to be paid their next City, or reſponſible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and the Bills thereon ſent to them to deliver and pay (as His Majeſty ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point) the ſaid Bill-Money, and ſo be obliged to pay and take in all the ſaid Bills, as faſt as they Receive their County Tax.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The like for Rebuilding <hi>London,</hi> to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Chamber there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to whom the King ſends as many Bills as is found needful; and ſo they to be accomptable, and take in their Bills as the Fines and Rents of what they Build herewith, bring in to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The like for Mounts of Piety and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Fiſhery, ſome convenient Corporations or reſponſible Commiſſioners, bound for the juſt expending their Bills, and repaying with the profits as they come in.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By this way, all the Countrey-mans Wool and Grain, the Clothiers Cloth, the Miners Tin, Lead, Coal, and all durable ſure ſailable Commodities, may be taken off; and ſo all Workmen ſtill imployed, and all heads and hands ſet to work.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100706:6"/>
5. What the King will, and juſtly may challenge to himſelf for the uſe of this His Bill-Money (to us as ſerviceable as Silver) I know not; but am ſure we can no where elſe have it under Six <hi>per cent,</hi> nor enough ſo. Nor can our King be too rich, but we ſhall fare the better by it, and pay the leſs Taxes.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think we get by ſcrewing any of His Rights from Him, whom we muſt preſerve potent and able to defend us, or all come to ſpeedy and certain ruine.</p>
            <p>How this Bill-Money may be kept from Counterfeiting, or unjuſt augmenting, I can moſt cleerly demonſtrate and ſecure, if I find what I have ſaid approved and acceptable; Hopeing that my Mite may be received into the grand Treaſury of better judgments; as the ſimple Countrey-man's project, to take the height of a Tree (by comparing the ſhadow of his Staff, with that of the Tree) was to the ingenious Mathematicians.</p>
